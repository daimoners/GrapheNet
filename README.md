# GrapheNet

This is the code used to produce the results presented in the paper called **GrapheNet: a deep learning framework for predicting the physical and electronic properties of nanographenes using images**.  
The paper is about using computer vision techniques (and in particular convolutional neural networks) to predict the electronic properties of graphene and graphene-oxyde flakes. The neural networks are implemented in `Python` using the `PyTorch` framework.
